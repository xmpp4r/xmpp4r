  childclasses, support for collection node creation

* initial support for XEP-0118 User Tune
* fix for an xmlrpc exception-during-serialisation bug, which would cause
  a hang
* Support auto-gem generation on GitHub with improved and DRY'er RakeFile and
  gemspec.
* Add support for the old SSL protocol (needed to connect to GTalk)
* Changed API for Client, Component, Connection, Stream to remove
  need for antiquated 'threaded' param in the initializer.
* Use a Logger instance instead of directly writing to stdout
* Re-factored & consolidated Error classes.  See xmpp4r/errors.rb for all
  custom errors that can be caught.  All inherit from Jabber::Error which
  itself inherits from Ruby's StandardError. This is a first step in
  re-factoring errors.  The next step will be to convert all 'raise' calls to
  raise a custom Jabber::Error or one of its children instead of anonymous
  RuntimeErrors.  This allows much more granularity in catching and handling
  errors later.
  If you were catching Jabber::ErrorException before you should probably
  change that in your code to now catch Jabber::Error if you want to
  catch everything or one of the custom children of Jabber::Error defined in
  'lib/xmpp4r/errors.rb'.  Additionally, the Error class which encapsulated
  the xmpp error response, has been renamed to ErrorResponse to reflect its
  real usage.  This free's up 'Jabber::Error' for use as our base Error class.
